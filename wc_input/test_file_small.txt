One of the first problems you'll encounter in data
 engineering is Word Count, which takes in a text file or set
 of text files from a directory and outputs the number of
 occurrences for each word.  For example, Word Count on a
 file containing the following passage:
 
  first part of the coding challenge is to implement your own
 version of Word Count that counts all the words from the
 text files contained in a directory named wc_input
 and outputs the counts (in alphabetical order) to
 a file named wc_result.txt,which
 is placed in a directory named wc_output.
 Another
 common problem is the Running Median - which keeps track of
 the median for a stream of numbers, updating the median for
 each new number.  The second part of the coding challenge is
 to implement a running median for the number of words per
 line of text.  Consider each line in a text file as a new
 stream of words, and find the median number of words per
 line, up to that point (i.e. the median for that line and
 all the previous lines).  For example, the first line of the
 passage
